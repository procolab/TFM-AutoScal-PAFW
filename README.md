Terraform: It is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code. It allows you to define your desired infrastructure state in human-readable configuration files, and then automatically provisions and manages that infrastructure on various cloud platforms or on-premises environments.

Palo Alto Firewall: Palo Alto Networks is a leading cybersecurity company that specializes in providing advanced network security solutions, including Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs). These firewalls are designed to offer comprehensive protection against a wide range of cyber threats.

AWS: Amazon Web Services, is a comprehensive cloud computing platform offered by Amazon.com. It provides a wide range of services that enable individuals and organizations to store and process data, run applications, and deploy infrastructure, all without the need to manage physical hardware.

Auto-Scaling: Auto-scaling, also known as automatic scaling, is a cloud computing technique that dynamically allocates computational resources based on system demand. It ensures that applications have the resources they need to maintain consistent availability and performance, while also promoting efficient resource utilization and minimizing costs.
